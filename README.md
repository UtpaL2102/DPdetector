# DPdetector
Dark pattern detection
Introducing "DPdetector," an innovative web browser extension designed for proactive Dark Pattern Recognition. Unlike traditional ad blockers, DPdetector enhances user awareness by highlighting deceptive patterns without blocking content. The extension introduces a hover feature, allowing users to selectively highlight ads when hovering over them, providing real-time feedback on the deceptive nature of the ad.

Key Features:

1. *Non-Intrusive Content Access:*
   DPdetector ensures an uninterrupted browsing experience by not blocking web page content. Users can access information while benefiting from active dark pattern detection.

2. *Dynamic Extension Icon:*
   The extension's icon dynamically displays the number of detected dark patterns, offering users a quick visual cue to potential issues on the webpage.

3. *Granular Pattern Highlighting:*
   Users can individually highlight each detected dark pattern from a selection of types, empowering them to address specific issues affecting their online experience.

4. *Hover Feature for Ads:*
   DPdetector introduces a unique hover feature, enabling users to highlight ads selectively. When hovering over an ad, the extension provides real-time feedback on whether the ad is deceptive or not, enhancing user control and decision-making.

In the broader context, our project involves a comprehensive workflow for a deceptive ad pattern detector. The process includes extracting data and images from the Document Object Model (DOM), followed by preprocessing. A key innovation lies in employing the open-source LLM (LLAVA) model for image-to-text conversion. The generated text summaries undergo Natural Language Processing (NLP) for detecting dark patterns in advertising. Subsequently, the detected patterns influence the update of the DOM tree, providing an integrated solution for identifying and mitigating deceptive ad practices. This multifaceted approach contributes to advancing the capabilities of ad fraud detection, making our project a significant stride towards a more secure and user-centric web experience.
